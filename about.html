            <h2>About the International Research Laboratory of Experimental Technology</h2>
            <image src="images/Lab2.jpeg">
            <p>
                Established in 2010 by name, 
                International Research Laboratory of Experimental Technology has been developing gadgets.
                As a company we are looking to innovate the way our society thrives.
                By modifying resources deemed unuseful to society into modern technological feats.
                In the past nine years we already developed and patented:
                <h3>Time machine</h3>
                <p>
                    We previously invented a time machine allowing for intertime travel. Accomplished through the use of FTL drives that we are currently upgrading.
                    The ability for time travel as of 2020 is only a measly 10 years, however with new FTL drives we believe we can reach centuries away.
                </p>

                <h3>Pocket bike</h3>
                <p>
                    After Lamborgini invented a foldable bike, We strove to foster the new generation of bike.
                    This was done through the creation of the pocket bike. This futuristic bike can be summoned back into a ball type capsule to be stored for later use.
                </p>

                <h3>Jet packs for dogs</h3>
                <p>
                    Jet packs for humans have been invented but what about or furry little best friends?
                    We had to repay or best companions with a special treat. 
                    We invented Jet packs for dogs as a way of payment, however there are many practical uses aswell.
                    Longer games of fetch, Rescue dogs have more reach, and over all enhanced movement.
