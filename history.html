            History
        </h1>
            <p>
                Our company was founded in 2042 by Elom Nusk, who had a vision for the future of
                humanity that was one of solutions. He created this company with progress in mind, making
                sure that his legacy would be one of forward thinking, constant learning, and using our knowledge
                 to help as many people as we can. Using those values as the base, we grew from a startup funded by private backers 
                 and eventually became the top research and developement in the country. 
            </p>
